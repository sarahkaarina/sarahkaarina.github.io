# About me

I am currently a post-doctoral researcher working with [Michael Lombardo](https://www.iit.it/people-details/-/people/michael-lombardo) at the **Laboratory for Autism and Neuroodevelopmental Disorders** in Rovereto, Italy. My PhD was completed at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of [Jenny Gibson](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/people/staff/gibson/) and [Napoleon Katsos](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/nk248), where I worked on the relationship between multilingualism and autistic traits. 

The driving focus of my work is to ensure that research can be as inclusive as possible in order to better understand and make inferences about the human mind, brain, and lived experience. To do so, I work on expanding on and/or developing novel frameworks to measure data where we expect a high amount of variability in a given population or where it's difficult to generate specific conditions, such as when collecting naturalistic data. My research interests have an emphasis on applications to autism, multilingualism, linguistic, and developmental research.

## Community involved research

One of the first projects (2014-2015) I was ever involved in the development of, was a study investigating the experience of motherhood for autistic women. We were approached by our co-author and autism advocate, Monique, who highlighted the current lack of formal research into motherhood and autism for autistic women. The initial idea was for the project was to simply runa survey, however, we were faced with the daunting task of having no previous published literature on the autsitic experience of motherhood. This led me on a quest to find a formal method for including the voices of autistic women that was research/publication suitable, where I identified uses of Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) and Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) models in sociological and medical research. Along my co-author, Dr. Pohl, my main contribution to the work was aiding in the development of a formal PPI model of research in order to engage the autistic community throughout our research process (Pohl et al., 2020).
