# About me

I am currently a post-doctoral researcher working with [Michael Lombardo](https://www.iit.it/people-details/-/people/michael-lombardo) at the **Laboratory for Autism and Neuroodevelopmental Disorders** in Rovereto, Italy. My PhD was completed at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of [Jenny Gibson](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/people/staff/gibson/) and [Napoleon Katsos](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/nk248), where I worked on the relationship between multilingualism and autistic traits. 

The driving focus of my work is to ensure that research can be as inclusive as possible in order to better understand and make inferences about the human mind, brain, and lived experience. To do so, I work on expanding on and/or developing novel frameworks to measure data where we expect a high amount of variability in a given population or where it's difficult to generate specific conditions, such as when collecting naturalistic data. My research interests have an emphasis on applications to autism, multilingualism, linguistic, and developmental research.
